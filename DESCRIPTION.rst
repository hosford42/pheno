Pheno is a genetic programming package for Python which supports the 
application of evolutionary algorithms to arbitrary phenotype design spaces. 
Pheno utilizes address/value pairs to linearize phenotypes, making it possible 
to apply standard genetic operators designed for linear chromosomes towards 
non-linear domains such as abstract syntax trees or artificial neural network
topologies. Pheno aims, through linearity of chromosomes, to make most of the 
theory developed for traditional genetic algorithms (e.g. convergence 
guarantees) applicable to all domains.
